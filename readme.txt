Check out the [screenshots](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/xili-language/screenshots/) to see it in action.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the folder containing `xili-language.php` and language files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory,
2. Verify that your theme is international compatible - translatable terms like `_e('the term','mytheme')` and no text hardcoded - 
3. define domain name of your theme - see note at end list below, 
4. Activate the plugin through the *'Plugins'* menu in WordPress,
5. Go to the dashboard settings tab - language - and adapt default values if necessary by adding your languages in the catalog. You can set the order (1,2,3...) of the series. (used in `language_attributes()` template_tag).
6. Modify each post by setting (checking) the language flag in xili-language sub-windows at the right of the editing window before publishing.

= NOTE = 
In the functions php file of the theme : replace by commenting `load_theme_textdomain` line  `//load_theme_textdomain('mythemename'); ` by a *define* `define('THEME_TEXTDOMAIN','mythemename'); //second text must be used in theme texts with _e( , ) or __( , )` where 'mythemename' is `'kubrik'` in default international theme.

Another example with fusion theme that offer localization :

replace

`function init_language(){
	load_theme_textdomain('fusion', get_template_directory() . '/lang');
}`

by

`function init_language(){
	if (class_exists('xili_language')) {
		define('THEME_TEXTDOMAIN','fusion');
		define('THEME_LANGS_FOLDER','/lang');
	} else {
	   load_theme_textdomain('fusion', get_template_directory() . '/lang');	
	}
	
}`

see the [recent post](http://dev.xiligroup.com/?p=427 "Transform a theme with localization").

= Browser detection =
To change the language of the frontpage according to the language of the visitor's browser, check the button in right small box in settings.

= text direction, since 0.9.9 =

Examples *for theme's designer* of functions to keep text **direction** of theme and of current post :

`
<?php 
	$themelangdir = ((class_exists('xili_language')) ? the_cur_lang_dir() : array ()) ; ?>
<div class="inside <?php echo $themelangdir['direction'] ?>">
...

`
example in loop :
`
<?php while (have_posts()) : the_post(); 
$langdir = ((class_exists('xili_language')) ? get_cur_post_lang_dir($post->ID) : array());
?>
      <div class="story <?php echo $langdir['direction'] ?>" >

`
minimal example in css :
`
.rtl {direction: rtl; text-align:right !important; font-size:130% !important;}
.ltr {direction: ltr; text-align:left !important;}

`
**Caution** : *multilingual theme with both ltr and rtl texts needs a rigourous structure of the css !*

= Archives selection =

Archives tags is a very complex template tag in his background and not very easy source hookable. So we decided to add few features : by adding query in vars of the function, it will be possible to display a monthly list of archives for a selected language - `wp_get_archives('..your.vars..&lang=fr_fr')` - or the current the theme language - `wp_get_archives('..your.vars..&lang=')` -. The displayed list of links will be translated and link restrited to display only archives of this language.


= Wordpress 2.8 =

= What happens if frontpage is a page ? =

Before publishing an 'how-to', since 0.9.9.4, the plugin incorporates now features that are formerly possible through the hookable functions of xili-language. The page frontpage must have her clones in each other languages. As for posts, if the user's browser is not in the default language, xili-language will display the page in the corresponding language if set by the editor. Be patient, a detailled post will arrive soon... [here](http://dev.xiligroup.com/?p=708#tab-1)

This first beta releases are for theme's creator or designer.
