xili-language provides for a multilingual website an automatic selection of language (.mo) in theme according to the language of current post(s). 

== Description ==

**xili-language provides for a bilingual (or multilingual) website an automatic selection of language (.mo) in theme according to the language of current post(s).**

* xili-language plugin provides an automatic selection of language in theme according to the language of displayed post, series of posts, page or articles. 
* xili-language select *on the fly* the .mo files present in the theme's folder.  
* Themes with *localization* can be easily transformed for realtime multilingual sites. 
* xili-language is dedicated for theme's creator or webmaster with knowledges in CMS and WP and having (or not) tools to create .mo language files. Through API (hook), the plugin add automatic tools (or links or filters) for sidebar or top menus. Categories or Archives lists are translated also. 
* xili-language provides also series of functions which can be *hooked* in the functions.php file of the theme that you create i.e. for a multilingual cms like website.
* With **xili-tidy-tags** plugin [here](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/xili-tidy-tags/), it is now possible to display sub-selection (cloud) of **tags** according language. With [xili-dictionary](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/xili-dictionary/) plugin (beta), it is easier to create or update online, via admin UI, the files .mo of each language.

= 1.1.9 =
Intermediate release :
* Optional improving hooking ways to be compatible with l10n cache of Johan's plugin see line 2200. 
* Automatic detection of `THEME_TEXT_DOMAIN` constant and languages (.mo) sub-folder in theme's folder. More infos in Settings UI Special sidebox.
* Fixes title of `wp_get_archives` links with current permalinks. Possible that very special permalinks need to use hook named `xiliml_get_archives_link`.

= 1.1.8 =
This release adds new features dedicated to multilingual theme's creators and webmasters. Some new php functions, a folder to include functions shared by themes (not necessary to put functions in functions.php of the current theme); example with a shortcode to insert link inside content toward another post in a language. A post explaining these improvements can be found [here](http://dev.xiligroup.com/?cat=480&lang=en_us). **Since this release, xili-language is also tested with future wordpress 2.9-rare.**

= summary of main features improved in previous releases up to 1.1 =

* improve `xiliml_the_others_posts()` function and theme tag to be used in multilingual category loop and by option (array) to return an array of linked posts in other languages (useful for CMS webmasters) (array of lang  and id ) - the id is easily transformable in permalink with function `get_permalink()` when using this array.
* New ways to choose default language of front-page, 
* Fix unique id for category link hook [see expert's corner posts](http://dev.xiligroup.com/?p=1045)

* link to modify linked posts in post edit dashboard UI
* New widget for recent comments that can subselect those for current language. (a function `xiliml_recent_comments()` is also available if you want to create a template tag with resulting objects array).

Check out the [screenshots](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/xili-language/screenshots/) to see it in action.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the folder containing `xili-language.php` and language files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory,
2. Verify that your theme is international compatible - translatable terms like `_e('the term','mytheme')` and no text hardcoded - 
3. define domain name of your theme - see note at end list below, 
4. Activate the plugin through the *'Plugins'* menu in WordPress,
5. Go to the dashboard settings tab - language - and adapt default values if necessary by adding your languages in the catalog. You can set the order (1,2,3...) of the series. (used in `language_attributes()` template_tag).
6. Modify each post by setting (checking) the language flag in xili-language sub-windows at the right of the editing window before publishing.

= SPECIAL NOTE FOR VERSION >= 1.1.9 =

With the cost of 50 lines more, plugin now detect automatically (if theme is good) `the theme_text_domain` and languages (.mo) sub-folder. It not mandatory to declare the two constats (but compatible with previous settings).
Only encapsule the `load_theme_textdomain()` like in that example for a theme named fusion:

`
if (!class_exists('xili_language')) { // class in not (!) present...
   load_theme_textdomain('fusion', get_template_directory() . '/lang');	
}
`

= NOTE = 
In the functions php file of the theme : replace by commenting `load_theme_textdomain` line  `//load_theme_textdomain('mythemename'); ` by a *define* `define('THEME_TEXTDOMAIN','mythemename'); //second text must be used in theme texts with _e( , ) or __( , )` where 'mythemename' is `'kubrik'` in default international theme.

Another example with fusion theme that offer localization :

replace

`function init_language(){
	load_theme_textdomain('fusion', get_template_directory() . '/lang');
}`

by

`function init_language(){
	if (class_exists('xili_language')) {
		define('THEME_TEXTDOMAIN','fusion');
		define('THEME_LANGS_FOLDER','/lang');
	} else {
	   load_theme_textdomain('fusion', get_template_directory() . '/lang');	
	}
	
}`

see the [recent post](http://dev.xiligroup.com/?p=427 "Transform a theme with localization").

= Browser detection =
To change the language of the frontpage according to the language of the visitor's browser, check the button in right small box in settings.

= text direction, since 0.9.9 =

Examples *for theme's designer* of functions to keep text **direction** of theme and of current post :

`
<?php 
	$themelangdir = ((class_exists('xili_language')) ? the_cur_lang_dir() : array ()) ; ?>
<div class="inside <?php echo $themelangdir['direction'] ?>">
...

`
example in loop :
`
<?php while (have_posts()) : the_post(); 
$langdir = ((class_exists('xili_language')) ? get_cur_post_lang_dir($post->ID) : array());
?>
      <div class="story <?php echo $langdir['direction'] ?>" >

`
minimal example in css :
`
.rtl {direction: rtl; text-align:right !important; font-size:130% !important;}
.ltr {direction: ltr; text-align:left !important;}

`
**Caution** : *multilingual theme with both ltr and rtl texts needs a rigourous structure of the css !*

= Archives selection =

Archives tags is a very complex template tag in his background and not very easy source hookable. So we decided to add few features : by adding query in vars of the function, it will be possible to display a monthly list of archives for a selected language - `wp_get_archives('..your.vars..&lang=fr_fr')` - or the current the theme language - `wp_get_archives('..your.vars..&lang=')` -. The displayed list of links will be translated and link restrited to display only archives of this language.


= Wordpress 2.9-rare =
Today, xili-language is 'compatible'.

== More infos ==

= What happens if frontpage is a page ? =

Before publishing an 'how-to', since 0.9.9.4, the plugin incorporates now features that are formerly possible through the hookable functions of xili-language. The page frontpage must have her clones in each other languages. As for posts, if the user's browser is not in the default language, xili-language will display the page in the corresponding language if set by the editor. Be patient, a detailled post will arrive soon... [here](http://dev.xiligroup.com/?p=708#tab-1)

This first beta releases are for theme's creator or designer.
