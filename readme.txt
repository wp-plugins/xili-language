xili-language provides for a multilingual website an automatic selection of language (.mo) in theme according to the language of current post(s). 

== Description ==

**xili-language provides for a bilingual (or multilingual) website an automatic selection of language (.mo) in theme according to the language of current post(s).**

* xili-language plugin provides an automatic selection of language in theme according to the language of displayed post, series of posts, page or articles. *If the post is in gaelic, the texts of the theme will be in gaelic if the author checks the post as gaelic and if the theme contains the right .mo file for this target language.*
* xili-language select *on the fly* the .mo files present in the theme's folder.  
* Themes with *localization* can be easily transformed for realtime multilingual sites. 
* xili-language is dedicated for theme's creator or webmaster with knowledges in CMS and WP and having (or not) tools to create .mo language files. Through API (hook), the plugin add automatic tools (or links or filters) for sidebar or top menus. Categories or Archives lists are translated also. 
* xili-language provides also series of functions which can be *hooked* in the functions.php file of the theme that you create i.e. for a multilingual cms like website.
* With **xili-tidy-tags** [plugin here](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/xili-tidy-tags/), it is now possible to display sub-selection (cloud) of **tags** according language. With [xili-dictionary](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/xili-dictionary/) plugin (beta), it is easier to create or update online, via admin UI, the files .mo of each language.
* xili-language plugin **does not create addition tables in the database**. xili-language simply makes proper use of the taxonomy tables and postmeta table offered by WordPress to define language and link items between them. Because xili-language plugin does not modify deeply the post edit UI, it is possible to use **iPhone / iPod Touch** Wordpress app to prepare and draft the post.
* **Documentation**:  A new [table](http://dev.xiligroup.com/?p=1432) summarizes all the technical features (widgets, template tags, functions and hooks) of this powerful plugin for personalized CMS created by webmaster.
* Check out the [screenshots](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/xili-language/screenshots/) to see it in action.

**IMPORTANT NOTE** : to prepare switch to WP3.0 (3.0-beta) single or multisite (wpmu) - see [Other versions](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/xili-language/download/). The most recent version remains compatible with current WP 2.9.x.

TRILOGY FOR MULTILINGUAL CMS SITE : [xili-language](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/xili-language/), [xili-tidy-tags](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/xili-tidy-tags/), [xili-dictionary](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/xili-dictionary/) 


= 1.5.0 = 
* incorporate automatic detection of theme domain for WP 3.0 and his new default theme 'twentyten'
* remains compatible for previous versions WP 2.9.x

= 1.4.2a =
* Rename two filters for compatibility with filters renamed by WP3.0. Incorporate posts edit UI modifications of WP3.0.
* no unwanted message in homepage when theme-domain is not defined - plugin must be activated AFTER theme domain settings.
* improved template_tags : xiliml_the_category, xiliml_the_other_posts (see source doc)
= 1.4.1 =
* Browser's window title now translated for categories (`wp_title()`). Option in post edit UI to auto-search linked posts in other languages - [see this post](http://dev.xiligroup.com/?p=1498).
* New option to adapt the home query according rules defined by chief editor. If home page loop is filled by most recent posts (via index or home.php), formerly, by default xili-language is able to choose the theme's language but not to sub-select the loop (without php coding). Now when checking in Settings *'Modify home query'* - no need to be a php developer.
* New widget for **recent posts** (able to choose language). This new widget solves conflicts or issues occuring when WP default widget is present (contains an *obscur* `wp_reset_query`). Also a choice of language of this list of recent posts is possible - not necessary the same of the current page. And you can install multiple widgets. **Replace WP Recent Posts widget by this one named** - *List of recent posts* -

= 1.3.x =
* New functions to change and restore loop's language query-tag (see functions [table](http://dev.xiligroup.com/?p=1432) ).
* Better dashboard post UI to create linked post (and page): *from one post, it possible to create linked post in another language and the links are prefilled. Just need to save draft to save the links between root and translated posts filled by authors.* [See](http://dev.xiligroup.com/?p=1498)
* fixes lost languages's link when trash or untrash (WP 2.9.1).


= summary of main features improved in previous releases up to 1.2.1 =

*(this chapter is rewritten for 1.4.1 - see readme in [previous versions](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/xili-language/download/) to read the chronology)*


* xili-language "*translates*" template tags and permits some variations for webmasters:

The most current template tags don't need special work: `wp_list_categories()`, `wp_title()`,...

`wp_get_archives` 
Possible that very special permalinks need to use hook named `xiliml_get_archives_link`. -
Sub selection of archives for `wp_get_archives()` with &lang= [see installation notes](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/xili-language/installation/).

`wp_list_pages()` with optional query tag &lang=

* xili-language "*provides*" new template tags (or widgets) to solve issues from WP core or add new features for CMS:

`xili_language_list()` - outside loop (sidebar) display the languages of the site (used also by widget)

`xiliml_the_category()` - replace the_category() template tag of WP Core


improved `xiliml_the_others_posts()` function and theme tag to be used in multilingual category loop and by option (array) to return an array of linked posts in other languages (useful for CMS webmasters) (array of lang  and id ) - the id is easily transformable in permalink with function `get_permalink()` when using this array.

* widget for recent comments that can subselect those for current language. (a function `xiliml_recent_comments()` is also available if you want to create a template tag with resulting objects array).

* ...
* Automatic detection of `THEME_TEXT_DOMAIN` constant and languages (.mo) sub-folder in theme's folder. More infos in Settings UI Special sidebox.

= Technical infos =


**Prerequisite: **
Verify that your theme is international compatible (translatable terms like `_e('the term','mytheme')` and no displayed texts 'hardcoded' (example in theme 'default-i18n' of WP).

* Based on class and oop - New settings UI according to new rules and style of WP 2.7 (meta_boxes, js) - *ONLY USE WITH Wordpress 2.7 and more* - Hooks (Action, Filter) usable in your functions.php.
* Optional improving hooking ways to be compatible with l10n cache of Johan's plugin see line 2200. 

**CMS:**

* Contains features dedicated to multilingual theme's creators and webmasters. 
**Documentation**:  A new [table](http://dev.xiligroup.com/?p=1432) summarizes all the technical features (widgets, template tags, functions and hooks) of this powerful plugin for personalized CMS created by webmaster.

* Some new php functions, a folder to include functions shared by themes (not necessary to put functions in functions.php of the current theme); example with a shortcode to insert link inside content toward another post in a language. A post explaining these improvements can be found [here](http://dev.xiligroup.com/?cat=480&lang=en_us). 
* Provides infos about **text direction** *ltr* ou *rtl* of languages (arabic, hebraic,...) of theme and of each post in loop see note [direction in installation](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/xili-language/installation/)
* unique id for category link hook [see expert's corner posts](http://dev.xiligroup.com/?p=1045)
* fixes unexpected like tags metabox added by WP 28 ( see [trac #10437](http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10437) ).

= Compatibility =

xili-language is compatible with the plugin [xili-dictionary](http://dev.xiligroup.com/?p=312 "why xili-dictionary ?") which is able to deliver .mo files on the fly with the WP admin UI (and .po files translatable by other translators). [xili-dictionary](http://dev.xiligroup.com/xili-dictionary/ "xili-dictionary posts") used a specific taxonomy without adding tables in WP database. 

xili-language is full compatible with the plugin [xilitheme-select](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/xilitheme-select/ "xilitheme-select") to be used with iPhone, iPod Touch or other mobiles.

xili-language is compatible with the plugin [xili-tidy-tags](http://dev.xiligroup.com/xili-tidy-tags/ ). xili-tidy-tags lets you create multiple group of tags. That way, you can have a tag cloud for tags in English, another cloud for French tags, another for Spanish ones, and so on. You can also use the plugin for more than multilingual blogs. Basically, you can create any group of tags you want.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the folder containing `xili-language.php` and language files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory,
2. Verify that your theme is international compatible - translatable terms like `_e('the term','mytheme')` and no text hardcoded - 
3. define domain name of your theme - see note at end list below, 
4. Activate the plugin through the *'Plugins'* menu in WordPress,
5. Go to the dashboard settings tab - language - and adapt default values if necessary by adding your languages in the catalog. You can set the order (1,2,3...) of the series. (used in `language_attributes()` template_tag).
6. Modify each post by setting (checking) the language flag in xili-language box at the right of the post editing window before publishing.
7. If you are webmaster and want to add lot of personalizations in your theme, visit [expert's corner](http://dev.xiligroup.com/?cat=480&lang=en_us).

= SPECIAL NOTE FOR VERSION >= 1.5.0 and WP 3.0 =

Nothing to do in functions.php : only verify that the theme is localizable and functions.php contains a function load_theme_textdomain(); and that the theme's folder contains .mo files (in root or a sub-folder) for each languages of your website. "twentyten" default WP theme is compatible.


= SPECIAL NOTE FOR VERSION >= 1.1.9 and WP 2.9.x =

With the cost of 50 lines more, plugin now detect automatically (if theme is good and contains 'domain' inside index.php like in kubrick) `the theme_text_domain` and languages (.mo) sub-folder. It not mandatory to declare the two constants (but compatible with previous settings). 
Only encapsule the `load_theme_textdomain()` like in that example for a theme named fusion:

`
if (!class_exists('xili_language')) { // class in not (!) present...
   load_theme_textdomain('fusion', get_template_directory() . '/lang');	
}
`
Sometimes, it is necessary to declare constant like below because index.php of the theme don't contain `_e( , ) or __( , )` functions.

= NOTE = 
In the functions php file of the theme : replace by commenting `load_theme_textdomain` line  `//load_theme_textdomain('mythemename'); ` by a *define* `define('THEME_TEXTDOMAIN','mythemename'); //second text must be used in theme texts with _e( , ) or __( , )` where 'mythemename' is `'kubrik'` in default international theme.

Another example with fusion theme that offer localization :

replace

`function init_language(){
	load_theme_textdomain('fusion', get_template_directory() . '/lang');
}`

by

`function init_language(){
	if (class_exists('xili_language')) {
		define('THEME_TEXTDOMAIN','fusion');
		define('THEME_LANGS_FOLDER','/lang');
	} else {
	   load_theme_textdomain('fusion', get_template_directory() . '/lang');	
	}
	
}`

see the [recent post](http://dev.xiligroup.com/?p=427 "Transform a theme with localization").

= Browser detection for visitors or authors =
To change the language of the frontpage according to the language of the visitor's browser, check the popup in right small box in settings.
To change the default language of a new post according to the language of the author's browser, check the popup in right small box in settings.

= text direction, since 0.9.9 =

Examples *for theme's designer* of functions to keep text **direction** of theme and of current post :

`
<?php 
	$themelangdir = ((class_exists('xili_language')) ? the_cur_lang_dir() : array ()) ; ?>
<div class="inside <?php echo $themelangdir['direction'] ?>">
...

`
example in loop :
`
<?php while (have_posts()) : the_post(); 
$langdir = ((class_exists('xili_language')) ? get_cur_post_lang_dir($post->ID) : array());
?>
      <div class="story <?php echo $langdir['direction'] ?>" >

`
minimal example in css :
`
.rtl {direction: rtl; text-align:right !important; font-size:130% !important;}
.ltr {direction: ltr; text-align:left !important;}

`
**Caution** : *multilingual theme with both ltr and rtl texts needs a rigourous structure of the css !*

= Archives selection =

Archives tags is a very complex template tag in his background and not very easy source hookable. So we decided to add few features : by adding query in vars of the function, it will be possible to display a monthly list of archives for a selected language - `wp_get_archives('..your.vars..&lang=fr_fr')` - or the current the theme language - `wp_get_archives('..your.vars..&lang=')` -. The displayed list of links will be translated and link restrited to display only archives of this language.


= Wordpress 2.9.2 =
Today, xili-language is 'compatible'.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to see post or page ID in dashbord ? =

*Reveal IDs for WP Admin* is an efficient plugin [found](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/reveal-ids-for-wp-admin-25/) in WP repository.

= Since 1.4.1, after the translated lines, the parenthesis containing root languages *disappear* in sidebar categories list ? =

Yes, only translated cat name remains. But, if you want to recover the old behaviour, you can add **graceful to hooking features of xili_language** by adding this lines of codes inside the functions.php file of the current theme.
`
function my_rules_for_cat_language ($content, $category = null, $curlang='') {
		if (!is_admin()) : /*to detect admin UI*/
	      	$new_cat_name =  __($category->name,THEME_TEXTDOMAIN); 
	      	if ($new_cat_name != $content) : 
	      		$new_cat_name .= " (". $content .") ";
	      	endif
	    else :
	    	$new_cat_name =  $content;
	    endif; 
	    return $new_cat_name;
	 } 
add_filter('xiliml_cat_language','my_rules_for_cat_language',2,3);

== Upgrade Notice ==

As usually, don' forgot to backup the database before major upgrade.
Upgrading can be easily procedeed through WP admin UI or through ftp.


== More infos ==

= What about plugin settings UI localization ? =

It is simple, if you have translated the settings UI of plugin in your mother language, you send us a message through the contact form that contains the link to your site where you have add the .po and .mo files. Don't forget to fill the header of the .po file with your name and email. If all is ok, the files will be added to the xili-language wp plugins repository. Because I am not able to verify the content, you remain responsible of your translation.


= What happens if frontpage is a page ? =

Since 0.9.9.4, the plugin incorporates now features that are formerly possible through the hookable functions of xili-language. The page frontpage must have her clones in each other languages. As for posts, if the user's browser is not in the default language, xili-language will display the page in the corresponding language if set by the editor. [home page of website dev.xiligroup.com](http://dev.xiligroup.com/) uses this feature.
